With this "tool" you can bypass the FRP (Factory reset protection) on Samsung devices that have a security patch older than August 2022 (almost) entirely in your browser.

Why I say almost, is because to connect to the device you would need to have the Samsung USB driver installed, which you can download from [here](https://developer.samsung.com/android-usb-driver).

Other than that, everything happens in the browser and locally on your computer, no server-side processing.

# How to use

- Make sure you are using a chromium based browser (Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera...)
- Make sure drivers are installed
- On your phone click "Emergency Dialer"
- Type *#0*# to enter "Test mode"
- When you are there, connect your device to your computer with a USB cable
- Either open the [demonstration site](https://serial.rf.gd/frp/) or run the code in this repository locally
- In the tool select "Connect" in the WebSerial section
- In the popup dialog select your device (For me its something along the lines of "CDC Abstract Control Model (ACM) (COM16)")
- After you have connected to your device, just click the buttons in order
- If you are done with that, click "Disconnect"
- Next repeat the same steps in the WebUSB section (Connect, Click buttons in order)
- If you have done everything correctly, after clicking the "Reboot" button your device should restart and you should be either on the lock screen or in the system
- On some devices you will still need to continue with the setup

#### Upadte:
An automated version is now available [here](https://serial.rf.gd/autofrp/)

# Known Issues

## Getting "The device has been lost" when sending DEBUGLVC command

### Cause:
The command "AT+DEBUGLVC" changes the USB configuration of the device, causing it to disconnect from the computer.

### Solution:
Refresh the site and reconnect to the device, after that press it again and continue with the procedure
